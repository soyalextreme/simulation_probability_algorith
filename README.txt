In this project, the program calculates the probability of a number to apear in N time you throw a dice.
To get a more accurate probability the algorith simulates the proces 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 times the proces.
Then the program shows the result in two graphs. Probability of appearing and probability of no appearing.
